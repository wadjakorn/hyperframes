 * error is re-thrown unchanged, preserving citty's print + exit-1 behavior.
 *
 * `onFailure` is awaited so it can resolve the (lazily-loaded) telemetry module
 * before the error propagates — otherwise a command that throws before the
 * telemetry import settles would lose its event. A throw from `onFailure` is
 * swallowed so telemetry can never mask the real command failure.
 *
 * Commands that call `process.exit()` themselves bypass this (the process is
 * already gone) and must report their failure inline.
